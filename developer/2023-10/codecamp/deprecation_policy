### Deprecation Policy Draft

### Timescales
- Algorithm not used for 3 years mark for deprecation
- Mark as deprecated for 2 releases before removing entirely

### Communication
- Deprecation announced in release notes - a separate deprecation list available from Index?
- Deprecation warning on algorithm info/help pages
- E-mail to announcements list?

### Soft Deprecation

Useful to use when we're creating v2, v3 etc of an algorithm. We make it clear that we are no longer supporting it (i.e. no longer developing it).
It is still safe to use but encourage users to use most recent version.

### Examples of other deprecation policies
