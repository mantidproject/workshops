Organising Committee
====================
[Technical Working Group](https://github.com/mantidproject/governance/tree/main/technical-working-group)

Preparing for the Workshop
==========================
The workshop will be split between presentations, short tutorials, and working sessions.
As a result, attendees are intended to bring a laptop capable of making changes to mantid, or have remote access to a machine that can.
The exact topics for the code camps are dynamic and will be determined by the attendees during the meeting.

There will be a windows machine in the meeting room to present slides from.
Alternatively, people can screen-share to the machine using MS-teams.
Things that are expected to be useful later, should be blended into the [mantid developer website](https://developer.mantidproject.org/).
