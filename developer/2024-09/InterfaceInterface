Base class for interfaces
Conda - pull in interface packages needed
Mechanism within Mantid to install different interfaces
  - be able to register new interfaces
Mechanism for updating interface packages
Use Mantid Properties file
GUI to enable user to select science areas? 
Expert mode?
Mechansim to tell user that new version available - news section? RSS feed or something similar?
  - we already let people know about new versions via new Error Reporter
What about users who are unable to update/upload software on their machines without permissions?
  - How would it work on IDAaaS
Each interface woukd probably require a minimum version of Mantid - can be done via the recipe
Does it have to be set up with Conda?
  - What about standalone versions?
Are there problems with conda local channels for testing? Probably need instructions in Dev Docs
Dependency management
  - base environment
  - sub environments that don't override base environment
- Needs to be user friendly above all else 
  - don't overcomplicate it for users
Some interfaces have external dependencies - how would that be managed
MSlice workflow that checks main Mantid against current MSlice repo - needs sharing/best practice
How will testing work
Interfaces have separate repository? Single repo? Sub modules (e.g. ISIS Controls/IBEX)
Need to consider carbon footprint
Mapping exercise to work out what should be put into interface and what should be shared in Core
Interface module to contain shared interface code e.g. styling
How would DOI work for referencing if interfaces on different versions from core?
  - versioning in meta data for reproducibility
  - MSlice use SHA reference
  - best practice for interfaces
We will need to produce an overall best practice for creating interfaces to interact with Mantid core
What will the developer burden be for separating out interfaces and developing them separately
Project saving/history
How will documentation work

Next steps
- Continue work with MSlice & share with project
- Work out where interfaces depend on each other
- Use Shiver as a test case?
- Documentation best practices for interfaces
- MVP Traing (14th October), template and documentation
- Discussion on architecture (Jan/Feb 2025)
