Base class for interfaces
Conda - pull in interface packages needed
Mechanism within Mantid to install different interfaces
  - be able to register new interfaces
Mechanism for updating interface packages
Use Mantid Properties file
GUI to enable user to select science areas? 
Expert mode?
Mechansim to tell user that new version available - news section? RSS feed or something similar?
  - we already let people know about new versions via new Error Reporter
What about users who are unable to update/upload software on their machines without permissions?
  - How would it work on IDAaaS
Each interface woukd probably require a minimum version of Mantid - can be done via the recipe
Does it have to be set up with Conda?
  - What about standalone versions?
Are there problems with conda local channels for testing? Probably need instructions in Dev Docs
Dependency management
  - base environment
  - sub environments that don't override base environment
- Needs to be user friendly above all else 
  - don't overcomplicate it for users
Some interfaces have external dependencies - how would that be managed
